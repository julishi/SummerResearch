#### And recently, both AlexNet and GoogleNet have been trained on skin cancer images to identify an image as benign or malignant, or in other if the patient has skin cancer, based on the image the network reads. 

The AleNet and GooglNet models have been trained and tested on the NVIDIA Jetson Tx2 which required other modifications to the neural network structure that isn't included here on this github repository.
