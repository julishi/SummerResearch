###  Machine Learning Research Project
#### Finetuned and trained AlexNet to identify Cats and Dogs.
#### And recently, trained and tested both AlexNet and GoogleNet to classify images of moles as cancerous or non-cancerous. The networks classify images of skin moles as Benign (non-cancerous) or Malignant (cancerous) based on the image the network processes. 

The AlexNet and GoogleNet models have been trained and tested on the NVIDIA Jetson Tx2 which required other modifications to the neural network structure, that code isn't included here on this github repository though. The scripts above were all used for resizing, cleaning the dataset, and making other necessary changes to the dataset so that the neural networks can train on the data.
