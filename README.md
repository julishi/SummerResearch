###  Machine Learning Research Project
#### Finetuned and trained AlexNet to identify Cats and Dogs.
#### And recently, trained and tested both AlexNet and GoogleNet to classify images of moles as cancerous or non-cancerous. The networks classify images of skin moles as Benign (non-cancerous) or Malignant (cancerous) based on the image the network processes. 

The AlexNet and GoogleNet models have been trained and tested on the NVIDIA Jetson Tx2 which required other modifications to the neural network structure my research teammate led and isn't part of the respository. The data we worked with was from the ISIC public database. The scripts above were all used for resizing, cleaning, and changing pngs to jpgs in the dataset so to create a dataset that the neural networks could train on.
